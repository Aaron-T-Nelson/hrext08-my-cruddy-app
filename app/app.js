When an input element is given a name, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's HTMLFormElement.elements property. That means if you have an input whose name is set to guest and another whose name is hat-size, the following code can be used:

let form = document.querySelector("form");
let guestName = form.elements.guest;
let hatSize = form.elements["hat-size"];
